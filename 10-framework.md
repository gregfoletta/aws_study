The AWS Well Architected Framework helps you understand, design and operate reliable, secure, efficient, and cost effective systems in AWS.

It's based on five pillars:

- Operational Excellence
- Security
- Reliability
- Performance Efficiency
- Cost Optimisation


## Operational Excellence

Is the ability to run and monitor systems. Principles include operations as code, annotating documentation, anticipating failure, frequently making small, reversible changes.

## Security

The ability to protect information, systems, and assets while delivering value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies.

- Automation of security practices when possible.
- Apply security at all layers
- Protect data in transit and at rest.

## Reliability

The ability of a system to:

- Recover from infrastructure or service distruptions
- Dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand
- Mitigate disruptions such as misconfigurations or transient network issues.

It includes testing recovery procedures, scaling horizontally to increase aggregate system availability, and automatically recovering from failure.

## Performance Efficiency

This is the ability to use comuting resources efficiently to meet system requirements and to maintain efficiency as demand changes.

This includes experimenting more often, using serverless architectures, and designing systems to be able to go global in minutes.

## Cost Optimisation

This is the ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point. It includes adopting a consumption model, analysing and attributing expenditure, and using managed services to reduce the cost of ownership.

# Benefits of the AWS Cloud

Six main advantages of cloud computing

- Trade upfront expense for variable expense
- Benefit from economies of scale
    - This tends to translate into lower pay-as-you-go prices
- Stop guessing capacity
    - Use scale up/down functions
- Increase speed and agility
- Reduce spend on data centres
- Go global in minutes
